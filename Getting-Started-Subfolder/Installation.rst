P4wnP1 Install Guide
====================

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Raspberry Pi Zero / Pi Zero W (other Pis don’t support USB gadget
   because they’re equipped with a Hub, so don’t ask)
-  Raspbian Jessie/Stretch Lite pre installed (kernel is updated by the
   P4wnP1 installer, as the current kernel has errors in the USB gadget
   modules, resulting in a crash)
-  Internet connection to run the ``install.sh`` script
-  the project is still work in progress, so features and new payloads
   are added in frequently (make sure to have an updated copy of P4wnP1
   repo)

Step 1 - Install Raspbian Lite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download:
   `Jessie Lite
   image <http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2017-07-05/>`__
   or
   `Stretch Lite
   image <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`__
   (recommended)
#. Follow the guide
   `here <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md>`__

Step 2 - Connect the Pi (Zero) to Internet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several methods are existing to do this

-  Method 1: Attaching an USB hub along with a Network Interface (NIC)
   and use it to connect to the Internet
-  Method 2: Put the SD card into another Raspberry Pi with built-in NIC
   and connect to the Internet (for example a Pi 3)
-  Method 3: This is the preferred one, as no additional hardware should
   be needed. Configure the Raspberry Pi **Zero** to act as USB Ethernet
   adapter and connect back to Internet through your host (Internet
   Connection Sharing on Windows, iptables MASQUERADING rule on Linux).
-  Method 4: How I do it currently (see
   ``"Getting headless Pi Zero online"``)

A guide on how to do method 3 could be found
`here <http://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-zero-ethernet-gadget/>`__.
Two things should be noted on method 3:

#. Most Raspberry Pi Zero USB gadget configurations interfere with the
   configuration of P4wnP1 (which for example doesn't use "g\_ether").
   The setup script of P4wnP1 tries to fix interfering configurations.
   If you encouter problems, please try another method to connect to
   Internet and revert the changes done to the bare RASPBIAN
   JESSIE/STRETCH image.
#. Unlike described in most tutorials (including the linked one), the
   SSH server on current Raspbian isn't running by default. You have to
   boot up the Pi into interactive mode and run
   ``sudo update-rc.d ssh enable`` (avoid manual changes to
   ``/etc/rc2.d/``, most times this messes things up).

Getting headless Pi Zero Online (my way, needs a micro USB cable + SD card reader + KALI Linux)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm doing this on Kali Linux, most other distros should be fine, too
(I'm working as root user on Kali, so depending on the distribution you
need to add ``sudo`` or change too root, in order to run privileged
commands). I don't use Windows 10 anymore, because the default USB over
Ethernet driver gets detected as "USB Serial device", which is hard to
overcome.

#. Prepare a fresh Raspbian Lite SD card
#. Mount the SD card to your KALI box **before** booting the Pi to first
   time.
#. On the boot partition edit the file ``config.txt`` and append the
   line ``dtoverlay=dwc2`` to enable USB gadget overlay.
#. On boot partition change insert ``modules-load=dwc2,g_ether`` into
   ``cmdline.txt`` between "rootwait" and "quiet". This enables the
   Ethernet USB gadget kernel module on boot.
#. Create an empty file called ``ssh`` in the same folder where
   ``cmdline.txt`` and ``config.txt`` reside, in order to enable SSH on
   boot.
#. The SD card is prepared. Install it in your Pi and connect a micro
   USB capable to the inner USB port of the Pi (the one marked with
   "USB" not with "PWR in".
#. Connect the Pi to your Kali Box and wait till it finished booting.

| So this should bring up a new network interface on your box, which in
  my case is called ``usb0`` and has to be enabled with
  ``ifconfig usb0 up``. The problem is, that the Pi runs a DHCP client
  on títs internal interface, waiting to receive a DHCP lease with an IP
  to use. As this lease will never be sent (as long as you haven't
  configured a DHCP server on usb0). We don't know the IP of the Pi. You
  could attach an HDMI monitor and the Pi will print out the IP used.
  But as promised, we do it in my way and that is headless.
| Now that the Pi isn't able too receive a DHCP lease, it chooses its
  own IP with a process called APIPA. I don't want to explain everything
  here, but one part of APIPA is important: Before the Pi chooses its
  IP, it has to check if any other host is using it already. This is
  done via ARP request. So if we sniff on our ``usb0`` interface,
  shortly after bringing it up, we should see an ARP request. To fecth
  this request, I personally use tshark, but every other sniffer should
  be fine, as long as you bring it up fast enough. So instead of running
  only ``ifconfig usb0 up`` we do the following.
| ``ifconfig usb0 up && thshark -i usb0``

#. Watch the tshark output, till you see an ARP request with an IP (who
   has 169.254.241.194 in my case)
#. Stop tshark with ``CTRL + C`` and grab a copy of the IP.
#. Configure your ``usb0`` interface to reside in the same subnet, I
   choose ``169.254.241.1`` and thus run the following command:
   ``ifconfig usb0 169.254.241.1``.

Important: If the interface ``usb0`` isn't configured to manual setup,
it is likely that a DHCP client is running. Trying to retreive a DHCP
lease would wipe the IP configuration done in step 10 (ending up with
Internet connection loss at some later point). The quick and dirty way
to circumvent this on Kali, is to stop the network manager service with
``service network-manager stop``

#. test if you could reach out to the Pi with ``ping 169.254.241.194``
#. If everything goes fine, you should now be able to login with
   ``ssh pi@169.254.241.194``

Two more things left. You have to configure your Kali box to allow
outbound masquerading on your internet interface (eth0 in my case), like
this:

#. ``iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`` to enable
   masquerading (don't forget to replace eth0 with your internet
   interface)
#. ``echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`` to enable kernel based
   routing on the Kali machine

Now KALI should be ready to root out traffic on its internet interface,
but the Pi doesn't need to know who is the rooter, so we tell him. From
the SSH session on the Pi run:

#. ``route add -net default gw 169.254.241.1`` (here the address you
   configured on your usb interface is needed
#. At this point raspbian should be able to reach the internet, test
   this with something like ``ping 8.8.8.8``

The last thing to do is to tell the Pi, how to resolve DNS names, with:

#. ``echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf`` where 8.8.8.8 is a
   google DNS which you could change according to your needs
#. The Pi should be online and able to resolve DNS names, test with
   ``ping www.google.de``

If you made it till here, your're ready to go on with P4wnP1
installation.

Login to Pi Zero online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Now you should be ready to login to the Internet connected **Raspberry
  Pi Zero** either directly or via SSH. Only the Pi Zero supports USB
  device emulation at time of this writing, so it doesn't make any sence
  to try this with another model.
| P4wnP1 setup is meant to be run by the user ``pi`` so use this user,
  the default password is ``raspberry`` which of course could be
  changed.

Install P4wnP1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter the following commands to install P4wnP1:

::

    sudo apt-get -y install git
    cd /home/pi
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1
    cd P4wnP1
    ./install.sh

| **Note: the ``--recursive`` is very important, the installation will
  fail if omitted**
| The setup process will take some time (installing packages, compiling
  pycrypto), so go and have a coffee.
| If something goes wrong you should receive some error message.

Run P4wnP1
~~~~~~~~~~

| If nothing went wrong you could shutdown the Pi and reconnect it to a
  Windows Box.
| To see the output, you could either connect a HDMI device or login via
  SSH (use PuTTY on Windows) with ``pi@172.16.0.1``.
