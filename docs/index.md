# P4wnP1 Wiki

*DISCLAIMER*

Most of the information here has been taken directly from the P4wnP1 Githib page. In the near future, I will go through every page and make the formatting and wording similar throughout the wiki as well as try to make it a bit easier to understand (for the not-so-advanced users).

_This wiki is a HUGE work in progress just like the P4wnP1 project itself. The info here comes from FAQ.md, README.md, and many issues in the original project. Keep in mind this block of text won't be here forever (hopefully)._

# About P4wnP1

### Introduction
P4wnP1 is a highly customizable USB attack platform, based on a low cost Raspberry Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi Zero W. Since the initial release in February 2017, P4wnP1 has come along way. A lot of the time has been spent troubleshooting new features and bugs in the old.

### P4wnP1 Features

* **HID covert channel [Frontdoor](Payload-Subfolder/Frontdoor-Payload.md)/[Backdoor](Payload-Subfolder/Backdoor-Payload.md)** | Get remote shell access to Windows targets via HID devices)
* **[Windows 10 Lockpicker](Payload-Subfolder/Windows-10-Lockpicker.md)** | Unlock Windows boxes with weak passwords (fully automated)
* **[Stealing Browser Credentials](Payload-Subfolder/Stealing-Browser-Credentials.md)** | Dumps stored Browser Credentials and copys them to the builtin flashdrive
* **[WiFi Hotspot](P4wnP1-W/Wifi-Hotspot.md)** | SSH access (Pi Zero W only), supports hidden ESSID
* **[Client Mode](P4wnP1-W/Wifi-Client.md)** | Relays USB net attacks over WiFi with internet access (MitM)
* **[USB device](Refrence??????????)** | Works with Windows Plug and Play support
	* Device Types:
	* **HID covert channel communication device** | [Frontdoor](Payload-Subfolder/Frontdoor-Payload.md)/[Backdoor](Payload-Subfolder/Backdoor-Payload.md)
	* **[HID Keyboard/Mouse](Advanced-Features.md#Advanced-HID-Features)**
	* **[USB Mass storage](Advanced-Features.md)** | Currently only in demo setup with 128 Megabyte drive
	* **[RNDIS](Advanced-Features.md#Advanced-Network-Features)** | Windows Networking
	* **[CDC ECM](Advanced-Features.md)** | MacOS / Linux Networking
* **[Bash based payload scripts](Contributing/Module-development.md)** | See `payloads/` subfolder for examples example
* **[Responder](Payload-Subfolder/Windows-10-Lockpicker.md#attack-chain-short-summary)**
* **[John the Ripper Jumbo](Windows-10-Lockpicker.md#attack-chain-short-summary)** | Pre-compiled version ready to go
* **[AutoSSH integration](P4wnP1-W/AutoSSH.md)** | For easy reverse ssh tunnels
* **[Auto attack](Refrence)** | P4wnP1 automatically boots to standard shell if an OTG adapter is attached
* **[LED state feedback](Refrence)** | with a simple bash command (`led_blink`)
* **[Advanced Features](Advanced-Features.md)**

### Feature Comparison with BashBunny

Some days after initial P4wnP1 commit, Hak5's BashBunny was announced (and ordered by myself). Here's a little feature comparison:

SumUp: BashBunny is directed to easy usage, but costs 20 times as much as the basic P4wnP1 hardware. P4wnP1 is directed to a more advanced user, but allows outbound communication on a separate network interface (routing and MitM traffic to upstream internet, hardware backdoor etc.)
