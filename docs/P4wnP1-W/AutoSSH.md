# AutoSSH

While the ability to bridge airgaps with P4wnP1 is certainly one of the most useful features, you are  limited by the range of the wifi accesspoint from P4wnP1. Even after the implementation of WiFi client mode, you were still limited to the local network, because exposing an ssh port to the internet is risky.
While searching for an easy solution, AutoSSH was discovered. [AutoSSH](http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/) implements reverse ssh sessions in a secure and **reliable** way.
